    comments: Store the collector sample ID. If this number is considered identifiable
      information, provide an alternative ID. Be sure to store the key that maps between
      the original and alternative IDs for traceability and follow up if necessary.
      Every collector sample ID from a single submitter must be unique. It can have
      any format, but we suggest that you make it concise, unique and consistent within
      your lab.

      mirror the GISAID accession. IRIDA sample names cannot contain slashes. Slashes
